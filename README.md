# Secure Vote 
A decentralized and transparent Blockchain-based voting application, built with Flutter, a Solidity Smart contract, Firebase and Infura as a project for KJSCE Hack 6.0

## The problem Secure Vote solves

1) Voting in most democratic states and organizations (at any level)all over the world has been a largely centralized activity, with immense trust and faith placed in the hands of a small number of powerful people.
2) Absence of a robust and secure authentication system for voters (like a biometric system).
3) Security issues with respect to the manipulation of EVMs - Rigging in elections is a major threat to democracy.
4) Another factor that negatively impacts the current system of Voting is the associated costs and other resources. For example, it was estimated that the Indian Lok Sabha Elections of 2019 cost $7 billion.
5) Both Digital Voting using EVMs and the Paper Ballot system have drawbacks - reliability, verifiability and security.

## Challenges we ran into
1) Using Truffle Ganache which provides a locahost environment for mining block on the dummy network. - Hence we used Infura
2) We used infura which also started giving issues like high traffic and busy network on ropsten test network.
3) Using web3 dart plugin for initiating ethereum client.
4) All these transactions sometimes failed or else took a lot of time due to high traffic, high gas prices and lack of miners which in all consumed most of our time in testing the smart contract.
